## [Machin3](https://twitter.com/machin3io) Drone Breakdown Shots

MACHINƎ was so kind as to allow me to use his drone as the image for Hard Ops 8 as had operatives previous however [he also shared some images](https:/imgur.com/a/NBl4E) of his process that is worth sharing.

He has the drone for purchase as an asset [here](https://gumroad.com/l/thSZ). It is definitely worth a study and up close look. It was amazing to see someone push the limits even further.

Also congratulations to his [top row](https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?405105-The-Probe).
